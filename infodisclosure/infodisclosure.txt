Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure script doesn't properly sanitize the username, leaving it vulnerable to potential NoSQL injection attacks.
For instance, a malicious user could input a MongoDB query like username!='', potentially accessing passwords for all
users. To address this security risk, the secure.js script includes username sanitization to ensure safer
handling of user input.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Confidentiality

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
- We should consider removing console logs that contain sensitive information.
- Implementing an authentication mechanism would enhance security.
- Encrypting the payload when transmitting information between channels is advisable.
