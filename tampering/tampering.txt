Question:
Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Answer:
The vulnerability arises from sending the "name" property as a raw string in the request, leaving it open to cross-site scripting attacks.
This lets attackers tamper with the input and possibly breach the system's security.
 The secure version resolves this issue by properly sanitizing all properties and variables received in the request, thwarting unauthorized manipulation attempts.
