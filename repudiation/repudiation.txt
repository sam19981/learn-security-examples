- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The insecure.js has a vulnerability that could cause non-repudiation since it cannot determine which user performed what action. This is primarily due to not logging the user's action.
The secure.js removes this vulnerability by adding a middleware to log the incoming request details.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
- Store the logs on a distributed database instead of storing it on a physical file on the same server.
- We can add authentication mechanism to avoid unauthorized user to tamper the log file.
- We can introduce some auditing script which looks for some patterns in the logs and notify us in case of any potential issues.
