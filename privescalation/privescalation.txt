• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.
- In the insecure.js script, the /update-role endpoint lacks an authentication mechanism to verify the user's identity.
Therefore, implementing robust authentication would enhance its security.
• What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such
attacks?
- We can add a strong authetication mechanism like 2FA.
