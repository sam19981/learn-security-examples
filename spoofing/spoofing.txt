Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The problem with insecure.js is that it allows session information to be set programmatically without restricting access to it.
 This makes it easy for attackers to hijack sessions or perform cross-site request forgery attacks.
 The secure version of the code fixes this by making sure that session data can only be accessed through secure channels, preventing unauthorized access and potential attacks.
