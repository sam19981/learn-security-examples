- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The script within insecure.js is considered insecure due to the absence of error handling during database queries.
As a result, if an error occurs, it could potentially cause the server to crash, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Adding a rate limiting mechanism is important because solely implementing an error handling mechanism might not fully safeguard the server
against potential DDoS attacks. Moreover, integrating input sanitization for incoming parameters would enhance security measures.
